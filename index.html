              <h2 class="major">Rats Playing DOOM: The Idea</h2>
                <p>Rats are one of the most trainable creatures on Earth for different kinds of tasks.
                  We wanted to teach them to play DOOM using a headset for rats and different inputs for movement and shooting.
                </p>								
                <section>
                <h2>The project</h2>
                <p> 
                    The goal was set we needed to find a way to make it. Hardest part was that we needed completely custom made 
                    hardware for the rats. So we used a ball to imitate the ground moving under the rat.
                    For the shoot input a trigger was made. Finally the rats can play because a vr headset is 
                    displaying the visuals.
                </p>

                <section>
                <h2>Vision</h2>
                <p>The most interesting idea we had was that we could use this to get the rats to play by only using their minds.
                  We potentially could scan the brain of the rats and look for the activity of the brain during the game.
                   After that we could train an AI model to pair the brain activity of the rats to the inputs. In the long run,
                   with enough data, we could make the rats play without the inputs and only scanning their brain activity.

                <h2>Visuals</h2>
                <p>The headset is designed to suit the rats' field of vision. It displays the image of the game.
                  An oled screen is put into the headset. This ensures that the rats are able to see everything needed for them to play the game.

              <section>
                <h2>Reward circuit</h2>
                <p>
                  We needed something that tells the rat whether they are playing well. We did this by using water mixed with sugar. The idea was that 
                  everytime the rats do something good (shoots a monsters, advances to the next area etc.) then the they get a little bit of the water. This would reinforce the rats to play the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The parts for the system are: mixer, pump, dispenser and the pumps. The mixer would be in a little container filled with
                  sugar and water. Before the gaming session the sugar and water would be added to the container 
                  and during it the mixer wuld continously mix them in order to have enough sugar in the water. 
                  After the mixing is done the pump would sip out the water into the tubes and forward it into the dispenser.
                  The dispenser is located on the headset where the rats can sip the water.
                </p>

              <section>
                <h2>Trigger</h2>
                <p>The rats needed somthing to shoot with. The problem was that their paws are used in the movement
                  so we need another method. We decided to make a trigger which the rats can push down with their heads.
                  This makes it so that they can shoot when it is needed but relatively little movement and energy to use it.

                <h2>Movement</h2>
                <p>We modelled the rats' movement with a ball. 
                  If the rat wanted to move forward it can push the ball backwards thus staying in the same place. 
                  Sensors would record the movement of the ball and update the game according to the 
                  displacement of the ball. The ball has two modes: one whare engines  can rotate it and the other where ball bearings 
                  allow for smooth controls.
