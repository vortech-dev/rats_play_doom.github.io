  <h2 class="major">Rats Playing DOOM: Intro</h2>
  <p>Rats are one of the most trainable creatures on Earth for different kinds of tasks.
    We set out to make them play Doom.

    <p><em>The different inputs for the rats.</em></p>
  </div>
  <p>
    We made a setup where the rats could learn the game. A monitor would display the game.
    The rats can move using the ball which simulates them walking.
    They have a trigger which they can use to shoot.

    <p>The most interesting idea we had was that we could use this to get the rats to play by only using their minds.
      We potentially could scan the brain of the rats and look for the activity of the brain during the game.
       After that we could train an AI model to pair the brain activity of the rats to the inputs. In the long run,
       with enough data, we could make the rats play without the inputs and only scanning their brain activity.
